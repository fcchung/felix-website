<!-- From Nathaniel: Here is my code review -->
<!-- I really like the transition when scrolling from the first section of the home page to the second section (about me) of the home page. -->
<!-- The background of the first section fading in and out and having the fixed image in the second section is a great interface for starting your webpage. -->
<!-- When navigating through your pages it does get confusing from time when I think the About Me link takes me to a different page. A suggestion could be to --> 
<!-- have a dropdown in the Home link where you have the About Me link appearing below the Home link (in the navigation bar).
<!-- I really liked how you implemented the reusability of your navigation element for your pages.
